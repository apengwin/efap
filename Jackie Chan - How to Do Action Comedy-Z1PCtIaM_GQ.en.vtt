00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.550
&lt;i&gt;--Hello? This is Jackie speaking.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.770
Hi my name is Tony and
this is Every Frame a Painting.
大家好。我叫Tony，这是Every Frame a Painting.


00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.300
Some filmmakers can do action.
Others can do comedy
有的制片人会拍动作片。
有的会拍喜剧。

:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.660
But for 40 years, the master of
combining them has been Jackie Chan.
在这40年，能把这些揉合在一起的大师就只有成龙。


00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
These days, there's a lot of movies
that combine funny scenes
现在有好多电影既有滑稽的场景

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.200
with fight scenes.
But even when the movie’s good
和打斗场景。
可是即使电影好看

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.030
the comedy and action seem to be
two directors and two different styles.
喜剧和动作像是两个不同的导演和两个不一样的风格。


00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.030
And that’s why Jackie’s so interesting.
所以成龙才显的那么有趣。

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.630
In his style, action IS comedy.
他的风格，动作片同时就是喜剧片。

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.200
And his work shows that the same
filmmaking principles apply
whether you’re trying to be funny
or kick ass.
在他的电影中都是同一种原则运用在滑稽或者踢屁股。

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.450
So let’s dive in. If you’d like to
see the names of the films

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.040
as I’m talking,
press the CC button below.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.500
Ready? Let’s go.
准备好了吗？开始。

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.830
So how does Jackie create
action that is also funny?
那成龙是怎么做到的呢？

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.360
First off, he gives himself
a disadvantage.
首先，他让自己处于被动。

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
No matter what film, Jackie always
starts beneath his opponents.
他的每部片，成龙处于对手的下风。

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.500
He has no shoes. He’s handcuffed.
他没鞋子。他手被铐。

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.360
He has a bomb in his mouth.
他嘴含炸弹。

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.800
From this point, he has to
fight his way back to the top.
从这起，他要打到最后。

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.000
Each action creates
a logical reaction.
每个动作都要有个合乎逻辑的反应。

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500
And by following the logic...
然后跟着这个主线。。。

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.500
we get a joke.
来个笑话。

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
In movies, this comedic style
goes back to the silent clowns
这个风格追溯到默剧里的小丑。

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800
like Chaplin, Lloyd, and Kea
ton.
卓别林，勞埃德， 基頓

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.000
But I think Jackie has distilled it
down to one line of dialogue:
可是我觉得成龙把它浓缩成一句台词。

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.450
&lt;i&gt;--Please! I said I don't want trouble!
我真不想找麻烦！

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.149
Because he’s the underdog,
Jackie has to get creative
因为他处于下风，他必须急中生智。

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.149
which brings us to point number two:
he uses anything around him.
这就来到第二阶段：
他必须利用所有可以利用到的道具。

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.890
This is the most famous
aspect of his style.
这就是他风格中最有名的那部分。

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.880
take something familiar,
do something unfamiliar.
用一些常见的东西，
做成不寻常的效果。

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.209
I’ve seen him fight with chairs
常见的用椅子打斗

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.209
dresses
裙子

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.209
chopsticks
筷子

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.209
keyboards
键盘

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.209
Legos
乐高

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.209
refrigerators
冰箱
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.800
and of course:
当然（梯子。。。）

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.530
Not only does this make
each fight organic and grounded
这些生活中常见的道具不仅让打斗变得有生命力更接地气

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.310
it also gives us jokes that
couldn’t happen anywhere else.
而且让观众忍俊不禁，这样场景生活中是看不到的。

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.000
Number 3: Jackie likes clarity.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.500
He doesn’t do dark scenes where
everything is color corrected blue.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420
If his opponent wears black,
he wears white.
如果他的对手穿黑色,他穿白

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.420
And if his opponent’s in white,
then he’s stylin'
如果他的对手穿白，他就花里胡哨

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.000
His framing's so clear that in each shot
he’s setting up the next bit of action.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Here, even though we’re
watching the stuntman,
虽然我们在看特技演员

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.250
two-thirds of frame is the staircase.
A few seconds later, we see why
这画面三分之二是后面的楼梯。
在不久我们发现为什么。

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.320
He keeps things clear by rarely
using handheld or dolly moves.
他极少运用人工或手推车，就为了让画面清晰。

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.160
&lt;i&gt;--Like American movies, there’s a lotta
movement. When the camera angle moves
在美国电影，所有东西都在动。如果摄影机在动

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.410
&lt;i&gt;--that means the actors,
they don’t know how to fight.
你就知道演员不真的会斗争。

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.190
In slow-motion you can see how the
camera operator swings around
慢慢看，

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.610
to make the hits seem more violent.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.620
But since Jackie CAN fight...

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.300
&lt;i&gt;--I never move my camera.
Always steady. Wide-angle.
我不

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.000
&lt;i&gt;--Let him see I jumping down,
I do the flip, I do the fall
让他看我跳下来，翻跟斗，摔倒。

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.000
When you shoot this way, everything
looks more impressive because

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
action and reaction are
in the same frame.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.300
Notice how you can always see Jackie,
the car and the wall at the same time.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.670
But a similar stunt from Rush Hour 3

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.500
never includes all the elements in the
same shot, and it doesn’t work.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
The same principle applies to comedy.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.800
This shot, directed by Sammo Hung,
shows us

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.780
the punch, the bad guy’s face
and Jackie’s face all in one.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780
Now check out the same gag
in Shanghai Noon.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.710
Here, action and reaction
are separate shots.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.200
It kinda works, but not nearly as well.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.700
Why don’t more directors do this?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.000
Because of number 5:
they don’t have enough time.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.270
Jackie is perfectionist willing to do as
many takes as necessary to get it right

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.300
And in Hong Kong,
he’s supported by the studio

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.800
which gives him
months to shoot a fight.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.300
&lt;i&gt;--And the most difficult thing is
when I throw the fan and it comes back.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.300
&lt;i&gt;More than 120 takes. Those kind of
scenes, you say "Oh, Jackie's good."


00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.300
&lt;i&gt;It's not good. You can do it. Except
do you have the patience or not?
一点不厉害。你可以做得到。就是看你有没有耐心。

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.750
When I rewatch his work,
these little things
在他电影这小

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.500
are the ones
I’m most impressed by.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
He doesn’t need to do them,
and they eat into his budget.
他真的不需要拍，而且很花钱

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
But he still does them
because he wants to.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.450
And it’s that “going above and beyond”
that I respect and admire.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.829
&lt;i&gt;--But in America,
they don’t allow you to do that.
可是在美国你不能这样子做

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.000
&lt;i&gt;You know, because money.
因为钱 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.900
And his American work is
missing something else:
而且他的美国电影还差一部分


00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.330
&lt;i&gt;--And there’s a rhythm also,
to the way that the shots are performed


00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.450
&lt;i&gt;and also the way they’re edited, and
Jackie said something very interesting

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.300
&lt;i&gt;that the audience don’t know the
rhythm’s there until it’s NOT there.


00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.080
Jackie’s fight scenes have
a distinct musical rhythm,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.680
a timing he works out
on set with the performers.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.720
&lt;i&gt;--Ready, action.
Stay where you are!
摄像，开拍. 别动

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.720
&lt;i&gt;Stay where you are,
don't chase me.
不要动。不要追

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
&lt;i&gt;See? Everybody looks good.
大家都好看。

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.750
Even experienced martial artists
have trouble with it.


00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.500
In his earliest films, you see him
learning the timing from Yuan Heping
在他最早的电影他从袁和平学到了这种节奏

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500
and it’s very much like Chinese opera.
有点像戏曲。

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.780
But by the mid-1980s,
working with his own stunt team
到80年代，他有自己的动作团队

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.110
He had something totally unique.
创造了一个很新很特别的风格。

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.500
In America, many directors and
editors don’t understand this timing.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.500
And they ruin it by
cutting on every single hit.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.800
By in Hong Kong, directors
hold their shots long enough

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.290
for the audience to feel the rhythm.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.960
&lt;i&gt;--The most important part 
is the editing.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.400
&lt;i&gt;Most directors,
they don’t know how to edit.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.250
&lt;i&gt;Even the stunt coordinators,
they don’t know how to edit.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.360
Hong Kong directors like Jackie
and Sammo cut a particular way.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.669
In the first shot, you hit
your opponent in the wide.

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.400
In the second shot,
you get a nice close-up.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.360
But when you cut the shots together,
you DON'T match continuity.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.979
At the end of shot 1, the elbow is here.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.300
At the beginning of shot 2,
it's all the way back here.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.600
These 3 frames are for the audience’s
eyes to register the new shot.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600
And they make all the difference.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.169
&lt;i&gt;--I start from here, then here,
But two shots, combined

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.250
&lt;i&gt;That's power.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.300
In other words, show it TWICE
and the audience's mind will make it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.120
one hit that’s stronger.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.500
By contrast, modern American editing
doesn't show the hit at all.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.660
At the end of shot 1, the leg is here.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.660
At the beginning of shot 2, it’s in
the same place, going backwards.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.690
But because they cut at
the exact frame of the hit

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.500
it doesn’t feel like a hit.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.340
A lot of people think this is
because of the PG-13 rating

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.200
but even R-rated films do this now

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It looks like a bunch of
people flailing around

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.760
instead of a bunch of
people getting hurt.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.500
Ouch.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.800
Which brings us to number 8: pain.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.400
Unlike a lot of action stars,
who try to look invincible

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.760
Jackie gets hurt.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.760
A lot.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Half the fun of his work is that
not only are the stunts impressive

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.300
There’s always room for a joke.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.500
Pain humanizes him. Because
no matter how skilled he is

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.250
He still gets smacked in the face.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.000
In fact, Jackie’s face may
actually be his greatest asset

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Many times the look he gives
is all it takes to sell a joke.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Like when he does an entire fight
holding a chicken.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.000
Or dressed as Chun-li

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.000
And last, Jackie’s style always ends
with a real payoff for the audience.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.500
By fighting his way from the bottom, he
earns the right to a spectacular finish.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.000
He doesnt win cause hes a better fighter
He wins because he doesn’t give up

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.000
This relentlessness makes his finales
really impressive and really funny

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.400
And it’s in direct contrast to
a lot of his American work

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400
where bad guys are defeated
because someone shoots them

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.000
COME ON.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.250
But most of all, I think
Jackie’s style proves something:

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.500
action and comedy aren’t that different.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.500
In both genres, we want
to see our best performers

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
And I think a lot of modern
action directors are failing completely.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.500
These actors are skilled artists,
some of the best in the world.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.000
Why are the directors so unskilled?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.300
Why am I paying money
to NOT see the action?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.000
&lt;i&gt;--Whatever you do, do the best you can
because the film lives forever.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
&lt;i&gt;"No, because that day it was raining
and the actor don't have time."

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.300
&lt;i&gt;I said, would you go to every theater
to tell the audience? No.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.300
&lt;i&gt;The audience sits in the theater:
good movie, bad movie that’s all

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.300
Exactly. This work will last.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.300
And on that note,
I leave you with

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.300
the greatest death scene
in film history.
